This document lists the enhancements and fixed issues for the Hazelcast Platform 5.2.5 release. The numbers in the square brackets refer to the issues and pull requests in Hazelcast's GitHub repository.

## Enhancements

* Improved the permission checks in the file connectors by adding a method that returns the permissions required to resolve field names. [#25674]
* Updated the versions of following dependencies:
  ** Snappy to 1.1.10.5
  ** gRPC to 1.59
  ** Netty to 4.1.100.Final
  ** Elasticsearch to 7.17.13
  ** Everit JSON Schema to 1.14.3
  [#24866], [#25820], [#25708], [#25729], [#25775]

## Fixes

* Fixed an issue where the entry listeners for Replicated Maps were checking the Map permissions instead of the Replicated Map permissions. [#25971]
* Fixed an issue where the map entries' metadata, such as time-to-live and expiration, was not replicated correctly over WAN after updating existing entries. [#25506]
* Fixed an issue where there was a difference between the elapsed clock time and elapsed total time when listening to migration events. [#25066]
* Fixed an issue where the member list was not updated after a cluster failover scenario. [#24944]
* Renamed the service port for Hazelcast clusters deployed in Kubernetes environments to hazelcast. The previous name, `hazelcast-service-port`, caused member auto-discovery for embedded deployments to fail. [#24841]
* Fixed an issue where Hazelcast was sending empty map interceptor information to the members that are newly joined to the cluster; it was causing eager map initializations. [#24669]

## Removed/Deprecated Features

* Removed the evaluation tool (for trying out Platform 5.x features for IMDG 3.x users) and the relevant IMDG 3.x JAR libraries from Hazelcast Platform distributions. [#25697]
