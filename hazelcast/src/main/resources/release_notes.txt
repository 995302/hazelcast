This document lists the new features, enhancements, fixed issues and, removed or deprecated features for Hazelcast IMDG 4.1.9 release. The numbers in the square brackets refer to the issues in Hazelcast's GitHub repositories.

## Enhancements

* Enabled XXE (XML External Entity Reference) protection for `XMLInputFactory`.
The related issue was reported through https://huntr.dev/bounties/d63972a2-b910-480a-a86b-d1f75d24d563/. [#20943]

## Fixes

* Fixed an issue where a cluster was unresponsive when you perform a health check to see the members are in the safe state;
cluster members were hanging in the `REPLICA_NOT_SYNC` state during such health checks. [#21205]
* Fixed an issue where the list of members in the cluster was reset to an empty list when member IDs change after a cluster restart:
this was causing startup failures since Hazelcast could not manage the events due to the empty member list after a restart. [#21181]
* Fixed an issue where the statistics like puts and removals were not increasing when these operations are executed through Transactional interface. [#21100]
* Fixed an issue where Hazelcast clients, which have only the IP address of a member to connect (but the member also has a hostname), were not able to connect to the cluster. [#20632]
