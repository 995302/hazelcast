This document lists the new features, enhancements, fixed issues and, removed or deprecated features for Hazelcast Platform 5.1.4 release. The numbers in the square brackets refer to the issues in Hazelcast's GitHub repositories.


== Enhancements

* Removed the `hazelcast-jet-cdc-mysql` module from the Hazelcast Platform Enterprise distributions due to licensing.
You need to manually download this module if you have the Enterprise edition. See xref:pipelines:cdc.adoc#step-4-start-hazelcast[Capture Changes from MySQL] for details. #5312
* The Kubernetes discovery plugin has been enhanced to support the service token expiration. The token is time-bound and its content
is refreshed periodically in the recent Kubernetes versions. A new token reader has been implemented to get the token value periodically. [#22394]
* You can now provide comma-separated lists to give multiple labels for the Kubernetes Discovery Plugin configurations `service-label-name`, `service-label-value`, `pod-label-name`, and `pod-label-value`. [#22401]
