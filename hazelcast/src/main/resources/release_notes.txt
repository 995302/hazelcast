This document lists the enhancements and fixed issues for Hazelcast Platform 5.3.2 release. The numbers in the square brackets refer to the issues and pull requests in Hazelcast's GitHub repository.

## Enhancements

* Updated the Janino dependency version to 3.1.10. [#25094]

## Fixes 

* Renamed the service port for Hazelcast clusters deployed in Kubernetes environments as `hazelcast`.
Previously, the name was `hazelcast-service-port` causing the member auto-discovery (for embedded deployments) to fail. [#25228]
* Fixed an issue where the `getDistributedObjects()` was returning inconsistent results when multiple members are simultaneously joining to the cluster. [#25153] 
* Fixed an issue where the Hot Restart procedure was failing on Hazelcast Viridian, when the cluster is in the `FROZEN` state. [#25081] 
* Fixed an issue where the retry mechanism for the communications between CP leader and followers was generating too many retries, due to incorrect backoff timeout reset behavior. [#25074]
