== Fixes

* Fixed an issue where Hazelcast was sending empty map interceptor information to the members which are newly joined to the cluster; it was causing eager map initializations. [#24667]
* Fixed an issue where `lastAccessTime` and `expirationTime` were not updated when an entry is accessed via `executeOnEntries`. [#24010]
* Fixed a parsing issue in JSON arrays when using predicate queries; it was causing the JSON query results to be varied according to the property order. [#23451]
