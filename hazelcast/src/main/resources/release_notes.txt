This document lists the new features, enhancements, fixed issues and, removed or deprecated features for Hazelcast IMDG 3.12.13 release. The numbers in the square brackets refer to the issues in Hazelcast's GitHub repositories.

## Enhancements

* Improved connection handling. [#21885]

## Fixes

* Fixed a split-brain recovery issue where the split clusters could not merge due to the missing master member
address. [#21860]
* Fixed an issue that occurred when there is Near Cache configured for both the member and client sides for the same map and `serialize-keys` option is `false`. [#18322]
* Fixed an issue where the Java client was not receiving membership events in its membership listener when a member with Hot Restart Persistence enabled is restarted. [#18271]
* The difference between the Near Cache configurations before and after a client is recreated with the same client failover configuration is fixed now. [#18168]
* Fixed an issue that prohibited Hazelcast from being used as Tomcat session manager when it is
also deployed in a web application context: When a client application that uses Hazelcast
tries to connect to the Hazelcast cluster and this application’s web sessions are persisted
using Hazelcast’s Tomcat session manager, the session manager could not connect to the cluster.
This has been fixed by improving Hazelcast’s service loader mechanism. [#18119]
