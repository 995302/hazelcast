This document lists the new features, enhancements, fixed issues and, removed or deprecated features for Hazelcast 5.1.2 release. The numbers in the square brackets refer to the issues in Hazelcast's GitHub repositories.

## Fixes

* Fixed an issue where a cluster could not be formed when security is enabled, various client permissions are set, and multiple members
are started simultaneously. [#21510]
* Fixed an issue where a cluster was unresponsive when you perform a health check to see the members are in the safe state;
cluster members were hanging in the `REPLICA_NOT_SYNC` state during such health checks. [#21208]
* Fixed an issue where the list of members in the cluster was reset to an empty list when the UUID of a cluster changes after its restart:
this was causing startup failures since Hazelcast could not manage the events due to the empty member list after a restart. [#21178]
* Fixed an issue where the statistics like puts and removals were not increasing when these operations are executed through Transactional interface. [#21107]
* Fixed a data race in `SingleProtocolEncoder`; while one method of this interface is called from the input thread,
another one is called from the output thread which was causing the race. [#20994]
* Fixed an issue where the automatic module name in `hazelcast-5.x.jar` could not be detected using Gradle. The reason was
`/META-INF/MANIFEST.MF` not being the first or second entry in the JAR file; now this manifest file is the second entry. [#20976]
